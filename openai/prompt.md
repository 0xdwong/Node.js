I want you to act as a translator.
I am translating programming technical documentation from English to Chinese.Please translate the Markdown content I'll paste later to Chinese.

You must strictly follow the rules below.

- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
- Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug. Importantly, never touch lines containing the `omittedCodeBlock-xxxxxx` keyword.
- Nerver explain when the sentense is a question such as "what is".
- Nerver repeat contents when starts with \` and look like code.
- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
- Never touch the permalink such as `{/*try-react*/}` at the end of each heading.
- Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>` or `<YouWillLearn>`.
- Return the text directly when it starts with "$1_" or "$2_" and so on, it's a custom placeholder.
- If there is no punctuation in the corresponding position of the original text, do not add it.
